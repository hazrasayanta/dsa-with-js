// String indexing refers to the process of accessing individual characters within a string using their position or index. 
// In most programming languages, strings are zero-indexed, meaning that the first character of the string is located at index 0,
//  the second character at index 1, and so on.

// Here an example to illustrate string indexing:



let str = "Hello";

// Accessing individual characters using indexing
console.log(str[0]); // Output: "H"
console.log(str[1]); // Output: "e"
console.log(str[2]); // Output: "l"
console.log(str[3]); // Output: "l"
console.log(str[4]); // Output: "o"


// In the example above, the string "Hello" is indexed from 0 to 4, with each index representing a specific character in the string.

// Its important to note that attempting to access an index outside the range of 
// the string will result in an error or undefined behavior, depending on the programming language. 
// Additionally, some languages may support negative indexing, 
// where -1 represents the last character of the string, -2 represents the second-to-last character, and so on.
